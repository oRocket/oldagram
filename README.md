# Oldagram

Oldagram is a simple webpage that mimics the design of a social media post, specifically inspired by Instagram. It includes a profile section, an image post, and interactive icons. The user can like a post by clicking the heart icon, which temporarily changes to a red heart icon and increments the number of likes.

## Features
- **Profile Section**: Displays a user avatar and details of a famous personality (Vincent van Gogh).
- **Post Section**: Showcases an image post with interaction options (like, comment, share).
- **Interactive Likes**: Users can click the heart icon to "like" the post. The heart icon changes to red for 1 second, and the number of likes increases.

## Live Interaction
- When the user clicks on the heart icon:
  - The number of likes increases by 1.
  - The heart icon changes to a red heart (`images/red-heart.png`) for 1 second.
  - After 1 second, the heart icon reverts to the original state.
